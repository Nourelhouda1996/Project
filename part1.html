        <p id="identity">This makes our daily decisions and actions very easy; we just focus on getting better and better as the days and years swing by. We continually invest in our lovely people & our amazing shops and we think that’s why our customers and team members tend to stick with us for a very long time. If you’ve never been into a Parsons Bakery shop, I highly recommend it. Hit our feedback link and let us know what you think as well. 
            Ok, the stats: we operate 50 stores over 10 different counties in the UK’s South West. 
            We employ some 500 local people and serve over 65’000 weekly customers. 
            We’ve traded through 2 World Wars, numerous relocations, several world recessions and major food shortages, won a trillion awards and grown up from making home deliveries by horse & cart in the early 1900’s into a modern artisan bakery that just keeps growing.
             I don’t think we could stop it if we tried!  </p>
